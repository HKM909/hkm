    <h2><li>CHICKEN CURRY</li></h2>
    <p>Procedure:<br>Marinate the Chicken:

        In a bowl, mix the chicken with yogurt, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge for better flavor).
        Cook the Onions:
        
        Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
        Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
        Add Ginger, Garlic, and Chilies:
        
        Stir in minced ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
        Add Tomatoes and Spices:
        
        Mix in the tomato puree, coriander powder, and salt. Cook until the oil separates from the mixture.
        Cook the Chicken:
        
        Add the marinated chicken to the pan. Stir well to coat the chicken with the spices.
        Cover and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        Finish the Curry:
        
        Once the chicken is cooked through, add garam masala and mix well. Adjust salt and add water if you prefer a thinner curry. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes.
        Garnish and Serve:
        
        Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with rice or naan.</p>

        <h2><li>GULAB JAMUN</li></h2>
        <p>Combine Ingredients:
            In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
            Add Flavor:
            Once the sugar dissolves, add cardamom powder and rose water. Let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes. The syrup should be slightly sticky but not too thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
            Step 2: Make the Jamun Balls
            Mix Ingredients:
            
            In a bowl, crumble the khoya. Add all-purpose flour and baking soda. Mix well.
            Knead the Dough:
            
            Add milk gradually and knead until a soft dough forms. The dough should be smooth and not sticky.
            Shape the Balls:
            
            Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth balls (about the size of a marble). Ensure there are no cracks.
            Step 3: Fry the Gulab Jamun
            Heat Oil/Ghee:
            
            In a deep frying pan, heat oil or ghee over low to medium heat. It’s important that the oil is not too hot; otherwise, the balls will brown too quickly and remain uncooked inside.
            Fry the Balls:
            
            Gently drop the balls into the hot oil. Fry them slowly, stirring gently to ensure even cooking. They will expand as they cook. Fry until they turn golden brown.
            Drain:
            
            Once golden, remove them using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.
            Step 4: Soak in Sugar Syrup
            Combine with Syrup:
            While the gulab jamuns are still warm, place them in the prepared sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes to absorb the syrup.
            Step 5: Serve
            Serve the gulab jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.
            Enjoy your homemade gulab jamun!</p>

            <h2><li>MATAR KULCHA</li></h2>
            <p>Heat a pan and add 2 tablespoons of oil in it. Now, add 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste and ¼ teaspoon of turmeric powder in the pan. Stir them and add 1 teaspoon of coarsely ground coriander, 1 teaspoon of red chilli powder, 1 teaspoon of chaat masala and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds.
                Cook the spices for a minute and then add boiled white peas in the pan.
                Stir all the ingredients well.
                Now, add the ground masala (which we ground previously in a paste) with the white peas and mix well.
                After mixing the ingredients well add ¼ cup of tamarind water and salt to taste in the pan. Mix all the ingredients in the pan well and after some time add about a cup of water in it. Allow the ingredients to cook for 7-8 minutes.
                After 8 minutes, turn off the heat and take the Matar in a bowl</p>

            Add tomato puree, salt, and cook until oil separates.

            <p>Cook soaked chickpeas in a pressure cooker until soft.
                In a pan, heat oil, add onions, and sauté until golden.
                Add ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, and chole masala; cook well.
                Add cooked chickpeas and water; simmer for 15 minutes.
                For bhature, mix flour, yogurt, and water to knead a dough; let it rest.
                Roll out bhature and deep fry until golden. Serve with chole.</p>
